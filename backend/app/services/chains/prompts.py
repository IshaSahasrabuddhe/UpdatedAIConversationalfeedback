TURN_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You analyze a user message inside a conversational AI feedback interview.
Return structured JSON only.

Required output format:
{{
  "intent": "feedback | rating | off_topic",
  "issue_type": "technical | usability | quality | none",
  "sentiment": "positive | negative | mixed",
  "is_feedback_present": true/false
}}

Rules:
- Mark intent as "feedback" when the user gives any opinion, complaint, suggestion, praise, or problem report.
- Mark intent as "rating" only when the message is mainly a score such as "3", "I'd rate it 4", or "2/5".
- Mark intent as "off_topic" when it does not contribute feedback or rating.
- If the message contains both feedback and rating, prefer intent="feedback".
- Choose issue_type="technical" for crashes, freezing, delays, failed actions, or broken behavior.
- Choose issue_type="usability" for confusing flows, difficult UI, unclear steps, navigation problems, or hard-to-use interactions.
- Choose issue_type="quality" for unrealistic, inaccurate, low-quality, incomplete, irrelevant, or incorrect output.
- Choose issue_type="none" if no clear issue type is present.

RATING_PROMPT = """
Extract a 1-5 rating from the user's message if present.
Support formats like:
- "3"
- "I would rate it 3"
- "2/5"

If the answer is vague, such as "it's okay", "fine", or "not bad", set is_vague=true.
When vague, do not guess a score. Ask for clarification in one short sentence that reminds the user of the 1-5 scale.
If the message is clearly a stop/closure message such as "no", "stop", or "that's it", do not treat it as a rating.

User message: {message}

You extract structured product feedback from a natural user message.
Return strict JSON only in this format:
{{
  "sentiment": "positive | negative | mixed",

  "negatives": [],
  "suggestions": [],
  "issue_tags": []
}}

Extraction rules:
- Capture multiple insights from one message.
- Ignore noise or irrelevant filler.
- Use short concrete phrases grounded in the user's wording.
- issue_tags must be snake_case, specific, reusable, 2 to 4 words when possible, and non-duplicated.
- issue_tags should describe root issues or requested changes, not emotions.
- Tags must align with negatives and suggestions.

Examples:
- "navigation is hard" -> negatives=["navigation is hard"], issue_tags=["navigation_difficulty"]
- "it took 7 minutes" -> negatives=["it took 7 minutes"], issue_tags=["slow_image_generation"]
- "puppies were not realistic" -> negatives=["puppies were not realistic"], issue_tags=["lack_of_realism"]
